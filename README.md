# Asteroids Game

This project is a classic implementation of the **Asteroids** arcade game using Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship that navigates through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and shooting down asteroids to survive. The game features dynamic movement, rotation, and shooting mechanics, along with an asteroid spawning and splitting system that challenges the player's reflexes and strategy.

## Features

- **Player Control:** Navigate your spaceship with smooth movement and rotation controls.
- **Shooting Mechanics:** Fire bullets to destroy asteroids before they collide with your ship.
- **Asteroid Field:** Randomly spawning asteroids that split into smaller ones when destroyed.
- **Collision Detection:** Real-time collision checks between the player, asteroids, and bullets.
- **Sprite Management:** Efficient use of Pygame's sprite groups for updating and rendering game entities.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
