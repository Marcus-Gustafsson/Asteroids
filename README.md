# Asteroids Game

This project is a classic implementation of the **Asteroids** arcade game using Python and Pygame. The player controls a spaceship that navigates through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and shooting down asteroids to survive. The game features dynamic movement, rotation, and shooting mechanics, along with an asteroid spawning and splitting system that challenges the player's reflexes and strategy.
